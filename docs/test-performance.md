# Test feedback-loop and CI performance

Developer waiting time is an engineering constraint. This document turns the
repository directive in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) into an executable lane
design without weakening the evidence contract in [`testing.md`](testing.md).

## Baseline and trigger

Governance run
[29696206056](https://github.com/fullofcaffeine/reflaxe.c/actions/runs/29696206056)
was cancelled by the old 30-minute `pinned-toolchain` timeout while it was still
making progress. The log established this sequence:

- the serial toolchain suites before the Caxecraft tail took about 19 minutes
  45 seconds;
- full Caxecraft QA took about 6 minutes 35 seconds;
- `snapshots:check` then regenerated the centrally registered suites and had
  run for another 3 minutes 42 seconds when GitHub stopped the job;
- every completed toolchain suite and all 11 independent platform, native,
  formatting, provenance, and security jobs had passed.

This was neither a compiler hang nor a reason to remove a gate. It exposed two
separate problems: unrelated suites were serialized on one runner, and the
central snapshot check repeated render work already performed by owning suites.

## Current lane topology

`npm run test:toolchain` remains the canonical, serial, cold reference command.
Its exact sequence is still guarded because it is useful for release-style
local reproduction and for detecting order/state leakage.

GitHub Actions partitions that same sequence into five isolated shards:

| Shard | Responsibility | Why it may run concurrently |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contracts` | pins, Beads plan, diagnostics, activation, typed boundaries, C import, AST/plans, runtime contracts, hello, HxcIR, primitive and stdlib contracts | separate hosted runner, checkout, process tree, and temporary roots |
| `lowering-objects` | bodies, functions, aggregates, classes, constructors, dispatch, enums, and generics | no filesystem or process state is shared with another shard |
| `lowering-semantics` | evaluation order, initialization, arithmetic, differential corpus, spans, and project layouts | native/compiler-server work remains serial inside this shard but isolated from the others |
| `caxecraft` | the complete split/unity, oracle, native, optimized, and sanitizer showcase lane | its long end-to-end proof receives its own resource budget |
| `snapshots` | all registered deterministic snapshot renders and exact comparisons | central ownership remains independently proved while de-duplication is designed |

The matrix uses `fail-fast: false`, so one failure does not erase evidence from
the other shards. A small `pinned-toolchain` aggregate job runs with `always()`
and fails unless the entire matrix succeeds. This retains one stable,
fail-closed status for branch protection while exposing the slow or failing
shard directly.

[`scripts/ci/run_toolchain_shard.py`](../scripts/ci/run_toolchain_shard.py)
owns the partition. Before any shard runs, it proves that concatenating the
five shard lists exactly reproduces the canonical `test:toolchain` sequence,
with no missing, duplicated, unknown, or reordered command. Adding a canonical
gate therefore fails CI until it is assigned exactly once.

Useful commands are:

```sh
# Validate the partition without running the suites.
npm run test:toolchain-shards

# Run one focused shard locally; each command inside it remains serial.
npm run test:toolchain:shard -- contracts

# Run the canonical exhaustive reference lane.
npm run test:toolchain
```

## Parallelization safety rule

Parallelize at an isolation boundary, not merely because commands look
independent.

Safe by default:

- separate GitHub jobs or separately provisioned workspaces;
- pure read-only policy checks;
- native compiler/platform matrix entries with distinct build roots;
- content-addressed work whose complete inputs and outputs are validated.

Serial until explicitly redesigned:

- warm Haxe compiler-server lifecycle and request-leakage tests;
- stale generated-file ownership and mode-switch tests sharing an output root;
- tests using a fixed port, singleton process service, or shared mutable cache;
- measurements intended to observe contention or sequential state;
- snapshot updates, which are an intentional reviewed write transaction.

Local multi-process execution will be added only after each admitted suite
declares its isolation class and receives a unique temporary/output root. A
configurable job count must default conservatively and must never make test
success depend on host core count or log interleaving. Until then, use focused
shards locally and isolated matrix jobs in CI.

## Budgets and observability

The first objective is a `p95` under 20 minutes for the aggregate required
GitHub check and under 2 minutes for an ordinary focused local gate. These are
initial objectives, not evidence-backed hard budgets yet. Record at least three
cold hosted runs before turning them into regression thresholds.

Every long-running orchestrator should eventually emit a machine-readable
timing record containing the suite ID, setup/run phases, outcome, and runner
class. Do not compare developer laptop wall time directly with hosted CI, and
do not label a change a performance improvement without a comparable before
and after sample.

Timeouts are containment:

- each isolated toolchain shard has a 30-minute hard ceiling while the new
  baseline is collected;
- the aggregate has a 5-minute ceiling because it performs no compiler work;
- a shard approaching its ceiling requires an owning issue and decomposition
  or optimization, not another silent timeout increase.

## Optimization sequence

1. **Partition without weakening.** Keep the serial reference lane, run five
   isolated CI shards, and verify exact partition coverage. This is implemented.
2. **Measure each suite.** Emit stable phase timings and collect cold `p50` and
   `p95` data for focused suites, shards, setup, and the full workflow.
3. **Remove duplicate snapshot computation.** Beads issue `haxe_c-xge.25` owns
   the design. Separate fast catalog/ownership validation from artifact
   regeneration, or consume an owning suite's render only when suite ID,
   generator version, complete input hashes, and artifact hashes prove it is
   equivalent. Keep a cold standalone `snapshots:check` lane until that proof is
   executable. Parallel execution alone does not count as de-duplication.
4. **Admit local concurrency by declared isolation class.** Add resource-aware
   concurrency only for suites proven free of shared server, port, cache, and
   output-root authority.
5. **Optimize setup and caches.** Cache only content-addressed artifacts keyed
   by the reviewed Node/Haxe/Reflaxe/native locks. Retain scheduled or release
   cold-cache evidence.
6. **Enforce regression budgets.** Once baselines are stable, fail or require an
   explicit reviewed override for meaningful wall-time, memory, generated-size,
   or runtime regressions.

## Non-goals

- skipping a slow semantic, snapshot, sanitizer, ABI, platform, or security
  gate;
- trusting stale generated output or an unverified cache;
- making every helper a CI job regardless of setup cost;
- hiding failures behind a successful aggregate;
- changing compiler behavior merely to make the harness faster.
