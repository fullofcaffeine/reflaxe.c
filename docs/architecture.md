# Architecture overview

## Core invariant

One compiler pipeline serves both `portable` and `metal`. Profiles select representation policy, fallback permission, diagnostics, and runtime constraints; they do not fork the compiler.

## Why `Manual` Reflaxe output

A compilation produces multiple file categories and sidecar reports. `Manual` lets the compiler control paths while retaining Reflaxe's changed-file and stale-file ownership behavior.

## IR boundary

`HxcIR` exists to normalize semantics that C syntax cannot safely express directly:

- evaluation sequence;
- expression-valued control flow;
- cleanup and exception edges;
- addressability;
- representation choices;
- allocation/ownership;
- dispatch classification.

`CAST` models C declarations and syntax precisely. It does not decide Haxe semantics.

The type model normalizes base specifiers and keeps them separate from a
grammar-level `CDeclarator` tree. Pointer, array, function, parenthesized, and
abstract declarators therefore retain their association without reconstructing
or parsing target-code strings. Final C tokens use validated `CIdentifier`
values; array bounds, parameter-list forms, C11 alignment/atomics, anonymous
aggregate specifiers, and compiler attributes remain typed nodes.

Expressions likewise retain their exact AST association. The printer combines
C11 precedence with grammar-category checks for assignment and prefix
increment/decrement operands, and inserts token boundaries where adjacent
unary operators could become a different token. Integer and floating constants
are validated representations rather than source fragments; `_Generic`
associations, comments, strings, byte characters, and `#line` anchors are also
structured or escaped at their owning boundary. There is no raw expression or
declaration node. Line anchors are syntax capability only: source-map policy,
sidecar provenance, and diagnostic remapping remain owned by E8.T08.

The printer's default dialect is strict ISO C11. Compiler attributes are
explicit extension nodes and require an explicit GNU or Clang mode. The
`test/c_ast` Haxe fixtures render deterministic declarator and
expression/statement goldens. The latter includes a literal 6×6 ordered
precedence-family matrix, every unary and binary operator, adversarial escaping,
and all statement shapes. Required GCC and Clang lanes compile and execute both
checked-in C files with no `hxrt` selection. This is a direct AST/printer proof
only; Haxe-to-HxcIR-to-C lowering remains fail-closed.

## Target and native baseline

The Haxe target identity is `c`: production typing uses
`--custom-target c=<directory>`, Haxe automatically runs `c.Init.init()`, and
the target installs its platform configuration before standard-library and user
typing. Initialization exposes the `c` conditional. `reflaxe_c` is an
implementation compatibility marker, not the application portability contract;
`c_output` is derived internal Reflaxe transport, not an application identity.

The target enables `target.unicode` without `target.utf16`. Other platform
defines are capability facts: `target.sys`, `target.threaded`, and
`target.atomics` are enabled only by adapters that implement them.

The exact Haxe 5.0.0-preview.1 carrier installs a static, scalar-Unicode
`PlatformConfig`. Hosted owns `target.sys`; other environment and concurrency
facts remain disabled until adapters prove them. The lifecycle snapshot uses
that real custom target, and full registration deliberately reaches `HXC1000`
without output while lowering is absent. Legacy Cross remains an `HXC0003`
negative because relabeling its UTF-16 state is not an architectural substitute.
Eval remains only the future CLI bootstrap host, an oracle, and a non-C
isolation target.

Strict ISO C11 without extensions is the generated-source, runtime, fixture, and
public-header floor. C17 preserves the same contract; C23 syntax remains an
opt-in internal experiment and may not change ABI. Support is resolved from an
environment/OS-runtime/architecture/compiler/capability tuple rather than an OS
name. See [ADR 0007](adr/0007-strict-c11-target-and-platform-baseline.md).

## Fail-closed bootstrap

The scaffold's compiler classes establish lifecycle and interfaces, but broad language lowering is not marked complete. Until a construct has a tested lowering, the implementation must issue a stable diagnostic. Silent placeholder code is prohibited.

## Runtime feature graph

Runtime planning follows representation selection, escape/lifetime analysis, and
specialization. For each operation the compiler prefers, in order: direct
idiomatic C, a program-local specialized helper, the narrowest dependency-closed
`hxrt` feature, or a policy diagnostic. There is no unconditional runtime core.

`RuntimeRequirementAnalyzer` records stable root reason kinds, consumed typed
surfaces, and source spans. `RuntimeFeatureRegistry` resolves deterministic
dependencies while preserving root-versus-transitive provenance.
`ProjectEmitter` copies/emits only selected features.
`hxc_runtime=none` asks `NoRuntimeEligibilityAnalyzer` for a proof; a failed
proof returns every blocking feature and source site. A successful proof is also
written to `hxc.runtime-plan.json` and means no `hxrt` include, source, define,
library, or symbol exists in the build.

Portable defaults to `auto + summary`; metal defaults to `minimal + warn`.
These are presets over independent axes, not separate compiler pipelines. See
[ADR 0001](adr/0001-direct-c-and-selective-runtime.md).

## String and managed-memory model

Portable `String` is a private immutable valid-UTF-8 representation. Every Haxe
index counts Unicode scalar values, embedded NUL is content, normalization is
never implicit, and malformed external UTF-8 has distinct lossy and checked
paths. Binary `Bytes`, NUL-terminated `c.CString`, and exported UTF-8 views keep
their own units, ownership, and lifetime contracts. String support is a separate
runtime feature and does not by itself require objects, reflection, or the
collector. See [ADR 0004](adr/0004-utf8-scalar-string-contract.md).

When object-graph semantics still require tracing after escape/region analysis,
the default `gc` slice is precise, non-moving, stop-the-world mark-and-sweep.
Generated trace descriptors plus explicit global/stack/thread root chains are
the authority; arbitrary C addresses are not scanned for roots. Interior and
foreign pointers require a live typed base/root or pinned handle. Backend
details never enter exported layouts, and `hxc_runtime=none` emits none of this
machinery. See [ADR 0005](adr/0005-precise-nonmoving-collector.md).

## Failure and unwind model

HxcIR represents exceptional successors, cleanup checkpoints, and all exits
before choosing C control flow. Closed regions use reported result/status
lowering when it is provably equivalent. General portable behavior selects the
isolated `exception` slice, whose strict-C11 frame/cleanup chain contains
`setjmp`/`longjmp` and handles C automatic-local rules explicitly.

Exports and callback trampolines catch and translate every Haxe exception to a
declared C status/error contract. A non-local transfer never crosses a foreign
frame, public ABI, signal, or thread boundary. See
[ADR 0006](adr/0006-explicit-failure-edges-and-contained-unwinding.md).

## Typed C authoring boundary

The compiler consumes C-native intent as structured typed facts, not normal-path
code strings:

```text
Haxe declarations and types
  -> typed c.* abstractions
  -> validated metadata/macros
  -> deterministic TypedCContractSnapshot
  -> declaration, header, layout, ownership, and build facts
  -> HxcIR / C AST / neutral manifest
```

Header/source grouping, forward declarations, includes, linkage, visibility,
calling conventions, qualifiers, layout, ownership, and compile-time assertions
share one declaration model with bindgen and ABI export. Haxe macros can reject
invalid combinations at the original source span; generated `_Static_assert`,
Clang-derived header facts, compiled probes, and C/C++ consumers provide the
native verification layer.

Ordinary Haxe comes first, followed by typed `c.*`, validated metadata/macros, a
narrow typed DSL only for a real language gap, and finally explicit raw C
authority. Every macro/DSL must expose its expansion and allocation, ownership,
unsafe, portability, and runtime effects. See
[ADR 0002](adr/0002-haxe-first-typed-c-authoring.md).

The M0 collector is installed once per C compilation and rebuilds its snapshot
from that compilation's typed module set. It owns no cross-build registry and
writes no files. Its report seam is test-only; the future compiler consumes the
snapshot and routes manifests and headers through Reflaxe output ownership. See
[typed C authoring](typed-c-authoring.md).

## ABI boundary

The internal object representation is not the public ABI. Export lowering maps Haxe values to a separate ABI model with:

- fixed scalars;
- frozen plain structs where explicitly selected;
- opaque handles;
- string/byte views;
- callbacks plus context;
- status and structured error outputs;
- explicit ownership.

## Build boundary

The compiler emits a tool-neutral `hxc.manifest.json`. CMake and Meson are adapters. Existing build systems can consume the manifest and generated source tree directly.

## CLI bootstrap boundary

The optional `hxc` orchestration layer is one target-neutral Haxe core with
narrow host-service seams for files, processes, environment, and terminal I/O.
It is not part of Reflaxe compiler registration and cannot be required for
direct Haxe/HXML compilation.

The bootstrap host is Haxe Eval, exposed through `haxe --run` and
`haxelib run reflaxe.c`. Once the C target supports the CLI's required semantic
and `sys` surface, the same core is compiled through `reflaxe.c` into the native
release executable. Eval remains the recovery implementation and differential
oracle. Native `hxc` must be rebuildable from direct Haxe/HXML plus the C
toolchain, never only by invoking an existing native `hxc`.
