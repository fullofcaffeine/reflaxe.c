# Architecture overview

## Core invariant

One compiler pipeline serves both `portable` and `metal`. Profiles select representation policy, fallback permission, diagnostics, and runtime constraints; they do not fork the compiler.

## Components

```text
BuildDetection
CompilerBootstrap
CompilerInit
  -> BuildContextResolver
  -> boundary macros
  -> Reflaxe registration

CReflaxeCompiler
  -> collects Haxe module types
  -> resets CompilationContext
  -> invokes CCompiler
  -> writes GeneratedFile records through OutputManager

CCompiler
  -> validates semantic contract
  -> lowers typed AST to HxcIR
  -> runs analyses and HxcIR passes
  -> lowers to C AST
  -> runs C passes
  -> invokes ProjectEmitter

ProjectEmitter
  -> public/private headers
  -> source files
  -> boot/export/reflection units
  -> runtime slices
  -> CMake/Meson/tool-neutral manifest
  -> runtime, symbol, stdlib, ABI, and lowering reports
```

## Why `Manual` Reflaxe output

A compilation produces multiple file categories and sidecar reports. `Manual` lets the compiler control paths while retaining Reflaxe's changed-file and stale-file ownership behavior.

## IR boundary

`HxcIR` exists to normalize semantics that C syntax cannot safely express directly:

- evaluation sequence;
- expression-valued control flow;
- cleanup and exception edges;
- addressability;
- representation choices;
- allocation/ownership;
- dispatch classification.

`CAST` models C declarations and syntax precisely. It does not decide Haxe semantics.

## Fail-closed bootstrap

The scaffold's compiler classes establish lifecycle and interfaces, but broad language lowering is not marked complete. Until a construct has a tested lowering, the implementation must issue a stable diagnostic. Silent placeholder code is prohibited.

## Runtime feature graph

Runtime planning follows representation selection, escape/lifetime analysis, and
specialization. For each operation the compiler prefers, in order: direct
idiomatic C, a program-local specialized helper, the narrowest dependency-closed
`hxrt` feature, or a policy diagnostic. There is no unconditional runtime core.

`RuntimeRequirementAnalyzer` records stable root reason kinds, consumed typed
surfaces, and source spans. `RuntimeFeatureRegistry` resolves deterministic
dependencies while preserving root-versus-transitive provenance.
`ProjectEmitter` copies/emits only selected features.
`hxc_runtime=none` asks `NoRuntimeEligibilityAnalyzer` for a proof; a failed
proof returns every blocking feature and source site. A successful proof is also
written to `hxc.runtime-plan.json` and means no `hxrt` include, source, define,
library, or symbol exists in the build.

Portable defaults to `auto + summary`; metal defaults to `minimal + warn`.
These are presets over independent axes, not separate compiler pipelines. See
[ADR 0001](adr/0001-direct-c-and-selective-runtime.md).

## Typed C authoring boundary

The compiler consumes C-native intent as structured typed facts, not normal-path
code strings:

```text
Haxe declarations and types
  -> typed c.* abstractions
  -> validated metadata/macros
  -> declaration, header, layout, ownership, and build facts
  -> HxcIR / C AST / neutral manifest
```

Header/source grouping, forward declarations, includes, linkage, visibility,
calling conventions, qualifiers, layout, ownership, and compile-time assertions
share one declaration model with bindgen and ABI export. Haxe macros can reject
invalid combinations at the original source span; generated `_Static_assert`,
Clang-derived header facts, compiled probes, and C/C++ consumers provide the
native verification layer.

Ordinary Haxe comes first, followed by typed `c.*`, validated metadata/macros, a
narrow typed DSL only for a real language gap, and finally explicit raw C
authority. Every macro/DSL must expose its expansion and allocation, ownership,
unsafe, portability, and runtime effects. See
[ADR 0002](adr/0002-haxe-first-typed-c-authoring.md).

## ABI boundary

The internal object representation is not the public ABI. Export lowering maps Haxe values to a separate ABI model with:

- fixed scalars;
- frozen plain structs where explicitly selected;
- opaque handles;
- string/byte views;
- callbacks plus context;
- status and structured error outputs;
- explicit ownership.

## Build boundary

The compiler emits a tool-neutral `hxc.manifest.json`. CMake and Meson are adapters. Existing build systems can consume the manifest and generated source tree directly.

## CLI bootstrap boundary

The optional `hxc` orchestration layer is one target-neutral Haxe core with
narrow host-service seams for files, processes, environment, and terminal I/O.
It is not part of Reflaxe compiler registration and cannot be required for
direct Haxe/HXML compilation.

The bootstrap host is Haxe Eval, exposed through `haxe --run` and
`haxelib run reflaxe.c`. Once the C target supports the CLI's required semantic
and `sys` surface, the same core is compiled through `reflaxe.c` into the native
release executable. Eval remains the recovery implementation and differential
oracle. Native `hxc` must be rebuildable from direct Haxe/HXML plus the C
toolchain, never only by invoking an existing native `hxc`.
